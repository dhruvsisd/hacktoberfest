Whereas slavery, throughout its entire existence in the United States, is none other than the most barbarous, 
unprovoked and unjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens against another portion, 
the only conditions of which are perpetual imprisonment and hopeless servitude, or absolute extermination, 
in utter disregard and violation of those eternal and self-evident truths set forth in our Declaration of Independence. 
Therefore, we, citizens of the United States, and the oppressed people who, by a recent decision of the Supreme' Court, 
are declared to have no rights which the white man is bound to respect, 
together with all other people degraded by the laws thereof, do, for the time being, 
ordain and establish for ourselves the following Provisional Constitution and Ordinances, 
the better to protect our persons, property, lives, and liberties, and to govern our actions.
